I'm a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cise.sdust.edu.cn/) of [Shandong University of Science and Technology](https://www.sdust.edu.cn/). My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence and Time Series Analysis, with particular interest in applying large-scale models to cross-modal perception systems.
